\abstract{Logging is largely underestimated. As a result what logs
  that are produced are mostly unhelpful or distract from what is
  useful. }

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand why logs are important, what we want out of our
      logs, and principles of good logging. 
    \item Patterns and best practices for writing good logs. 
    \item Tuning Kuali applications to produce useful information. 
    \item Using performance logging to determine information about
      your application and why that is useful. 
    \item Implementing elasticsearch and graylog2. 
    \item Monitoring and tracking behavior to detect problems before
      they happen. 
    \item Demo that brings it all together and shows all the previous
      points are true and positive.
