\title{Continuous Integration (Testing, Packaging, Deployment, EC2, Twitter, Jira, and SVN BFFs)}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{During implementation surprises can occur during building, packaging, or deploying KFS releases to 
environments. Troubleshooting will show that most of these problems could have been solved with proper testing.

Even with really strong testing, problems can still happen. The goal is to find these problems before there is 
no turning back. This session covers using continuous integration to solve these problems with KFS implementation. 
Also testing software regulary, packaging well-tested software, deploying packages to environments, 
cloud computing for sandbox builds, opt-in notifications with Twitter, Jira issue integration, and SVN reports 
and integration are all to be covered.
