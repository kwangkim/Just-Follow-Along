\title{Integrating LDAP and KIM (dood did it rong!}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{KIM's reference implementation requires a RDBMS datastore. For systems that work together, all will 
access to the same datastore for principal/entity information.
However, systems university wide will need
a common system for identity management and authentication. KIM must also tie-in 
authorization across software from the Kuali Foundation.

This session covers the ease of integrating Spring LDAP with KIM and the caveats of KIM integration and alternative
datastores. There are several customizations that need to be made within a KIM implementation. This session will
cover what those are and how to handle incoming Rice updates with your customizations of KIM.}
