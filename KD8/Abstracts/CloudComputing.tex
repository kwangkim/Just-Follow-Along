\title{Cloud Computing}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{Maintaining environments internally creates overhead costing money, people's time, and inconveniences the development process. 

Cloud computing reduces need for maintenance of hardware or personnel to oversee it. Since environments
can be used on-demand, one can be created instantly to deploy, run, and test without manager or admin authorization. 
The perfect solution for a sandbox or reducing the cost and overhead of managing a permanent server environment.

This session aims to explore the applications of using cloud computing for different kinds of environments that
would be needed during implementation. The benefits of cloud computing will also covered through cost comparisons.
