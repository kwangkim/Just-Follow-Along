\title{Data-Migration and Change Management for Implementing Institutions}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{
It is possible the Kuali Foundation will distribute database updates packaged with other changes. These database updates
will not consider data retention. Database changes come packaged from development. They do not take into consideration any
institution's desire to retain any data. Sequences, indexes, and access control are all recreated completely. The database state 
is all lost as well as data. 

This session covers intuitive and simple database change management process and how to integrate it with existing
data migration, change management, and foundation KFS updates.}
