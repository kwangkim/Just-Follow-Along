\title{Control-M Meeting Minutes}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Does there need to be an agent on each appserver for peoplesoft? 

\item No. It's dependent on your environment.

\item Only one Control-M Server with also a Test environment.

\item Clinton expressed a need for another environment for non-production tasks.

\item Peoplesoft control module is on the appserver.

\item Where does the control module go?

\item It can go anywhere. We don't have a place for the control module yet.

\item Good idea to have multiple agents for redundancy.

\item One agent per server.

\item Each agent will serve peoplesoft and kuali environments.

\item Put agents on windows.
c
\item BPI is a control module that can invoke java servers or EJB or web services. Deposit message in JMS Queue. May need Spring JMS.

\item Keep steps and jobs registered in Spring/Quartz, but have Control-M invoke them. All jobs become unscheduled.

\item Need to get Clinton a list of jobs to setup an agent within Control-M. Which job names? Only jobs from KFS, or also 
  non-production jobs? When are these needed?

\item All jobs are available to see, but a form can be setup to filter non-production jobs from certain users.
