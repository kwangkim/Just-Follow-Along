\title{Control-M Meeting Minutes}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Payroll is going to push information to KFS
    
  \item Agents or remote hosts? Remote hosts may require additional authn, but what about 
    username/passwords changing? Todd thinks rsa-key authentication can be used in lieu of
    password challenge/response.

  \item Are agents worth it? Jack Alfred thinks that it may not be worth it. If this is the case,
    maybe service accounts for control-m.
    
  \item Naming conventions. Kim is concerned about naming conventions for job names. PS already has
    a naming convention.

  \item Kuali uses web services run on an agent BPI Control Module. This may require ports to be opened
    to communicate between the Control-M agent and the KSB.
