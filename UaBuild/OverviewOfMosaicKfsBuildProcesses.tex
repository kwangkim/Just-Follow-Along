\section{Introduction}
There are several different processes or phases to building that can happen
in parallel to each other. That is, there is no single process that happens in
a series of steps that can be illustrated or described. The overall process, must
be described as a set of several processes or phases that happen independently
of each other.

\section{Deployment}
The overall process of deploying KFS and dependencies to a specific environment of DEV, CFG, CNV, DMO, TRN, TST, or STG.

\section{Building}
Where actual builds take place. Builds are verified and tested. Not all builds
end up packaged or deployed. Some builds may fail.

\section{Packaging}
The process of distributable representation of builds to be installed. Packages themselves do not need
to be tested, but rather the packaging needs to be tested.

\section{Inception}
Source code is pulled into the Version Control System.
