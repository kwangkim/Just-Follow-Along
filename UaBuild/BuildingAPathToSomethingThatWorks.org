- Any data that is copied from configuration is done at this time as well. It is
assumed that configuration data and conversion data are handled together. Currently,
copying of configuration data requires sysdba privileges. Continuous integration
runs without privileges, so it needs to be possible to copy the configuration
                       data without privileges.
