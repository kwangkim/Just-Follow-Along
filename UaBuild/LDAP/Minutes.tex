\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item What do we do about KFS Entity System Entity?
  \item What other services need to be implemented besides IdentityService and EntityService?
  \item What services are SJDC implementing?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item EntityService needs to be implemented to get Entity information. EntityService gone.
  \item Need to populate DefaultName
  \item EntityTypeInfo needs to state that they are ``Person''
  \item Set ``Person'' entity types as singletons too
  \item For System Entities, use a singleton in the system
  \item Don't use EntityService
  \item KimGroupDaoOjb KimRoleDaoOjb will break role and group lookups because they are tied to tables in the
    system.
  \item lookup methods in the IdentityService depend on mappings from the. Maybe copy code from the PersonService to
    handle the lookup ids.
  \item be sure to document workarounds.
\end{itemize}
