Rarely, is it the case that an enterprise java application can be
implemented as a turn-key solution. Some difficulties with
implementing enterprise applications in Java are development processes
for maintenance, ETL of legacy data, and software configuration
management. Tools are a large part of implementation. The University
of Arizona Mosaic KFS implementation used tools to smooth out its
implementation and help solve technical challenges in implementing an
enterprise java solution. This is a technical session that explores
the approaches to vetting and developing tools as well as the
technologies that went into University of Arizona's tools for the
Mosaic KFS implementation.
