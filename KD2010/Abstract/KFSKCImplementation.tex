\title{KFS and KC Implementation Technical Overview}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{Kuali Coeus and Kuali Financials are the one-two punch most institutions have been
waiting for. Both solve problems institutions have had in their own way. Together they fill a 
space for higher education. Many institutions are looking to implement these two applications 
either both at once or separately. The University of Arizona has decided to implement
both at once.

During this talk I will discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item The integration points for KC and KFS. 
\item The impact differing versions of Kuali Rice had on our implementations. 
\item Discussions made early on and the effects of those decisions later.
\item LDAP/KIM Integration
\item Struggles with differing datasets.
\end{itemize}

Attendees should expect to leave this discussion having:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learned the importance of coordinating these implementing projects.
\item Knowledge of gaps for integration between KC and KFS pivotal to implementing.
\item Awareness complications brought on by differing versions of Rice
\end{itemize}
