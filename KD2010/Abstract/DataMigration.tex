\title{Map Reduce for Data Migration}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{Migrating data from legacy systems can be a very long process. This is not just
the case for developing ETL tool, but execution time can have a devastating impact on the project timeline.
It is crucial to keep execution times down. Sometimes a single script can run for hours. Map Reduce
or other divide-and-conquer algorithms/paradigms can be used to optimize the cumbersome task of migrating
legacy data.

Attendees will:
\begin{itemize}
  \item walkthrough diagrams explaining the process of migrating data and where normal data migration 
    breaks down
  \item be exposed to scenarios where Map Reduce can be applied in data migration
  \item witness a working demonstration of Hadoop and KFS for migrating large amounts of data
\end{itemize}
}
