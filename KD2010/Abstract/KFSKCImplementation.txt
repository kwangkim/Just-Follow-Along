Kuali Coeus and Kuali Financials are the one-two punch most institutions have been waiting for. Both solve problems institutions have had in their own way. Together they fill a space for higher education. Many institutions are looking to implement these two applications either both at once or separately. The University of Arizona has decided to implement both at once.

This presentation will cover:

    * The integration points for KC and KFS.
    * The impact differing versions of Kuali Rice had on our implementations.
    * Discussions made early on and the effects of those decisions later.
    * LDAP/KIM Integration
    * Struggles with differing datasets.

Attendees should expect to leave this discussion having:

    * Learned the importance of coordinating these implementing projects.
    * Knowledge of gaps for integration between KC and KFS pivotal to implementing.
    * Awareness complications brought on by differing versions of Rice.
