\title{Integrating LDAP and KIM }


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\abstract{KIM's reference implementation requires a RDBMS datastore. For systems that work together, all will 
access to the same datastore for principal/entity information.
However, systems university wide will need
a common system for identity management and authentication. KIM must also tie-in 
authorization across software from the Kuali Foundation.

This session covers the ease of integrating Spring LDAP with KIM and the caveats of KIM integration and alternative
datastores. At the time of writing this, Rice does not have a reference KIM LDAP implementation. This session will 
explore the integrating a software extension within a KFS or Rice application.

Attendees will see and experience taking an existing Kuali application and adding a directory service datastore for
entities. The goals are that attendees will learn about what goes into mapping a directory service to KIM, and how
to implement the necessary service overrides.
