<h2>About this Book</h2>
<p>A cohesive collection of best practices that are not just intended as suggestions or "This is how I did it", but
comprehensively a tried methodology for accomplishing the goal. The goal is developing Kuali &trade; software plain and simple. 
This book isn't really a reference manual. I can see it being used that way, but its main intent and purpose is as a learning
manual and educational literature for helping people in specific roles adapt to Kuali software development. Far better references
