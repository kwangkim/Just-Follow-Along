<h2>Prelude to a KIS - Setting up and Getting Started with Mylyn</h2>
<p>This is my first screencast. I am going to discuss how to setup and get started using 
mylyn since both Jira and Eclipse are prominent Kuali development tools.</p>

<p><h3>My reasons for using Mylyn</h3><ul><li>Enforces one-issue-at-a-time 
practice. Many times, complex check-ins from working on multiple issues at a time is the
 cause of bugs.</li><li>Organizes files to an issue. This helps you focus on the 
task by blocking out files that don't matter and helping you remember what you were working 
on.</li><li>Issue management integration connects what you're working on with ... what
 you're working on. Issue metadata only available in Jira is something that can be lost
x when developing. Mylyn keeps your work connected with your tools</li></ul><br /><div></div></p>
