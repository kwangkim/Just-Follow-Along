<h2>Screencasts Coming Out Slowly</h2>
<h2>What's Goin' On?</h2><p>I know this isn't a kuali-related post, but it is related to the blog. I just started using Gnome 3 (with Gnome Shell) and KdenLive!!! This pair is incredible. Actually, KdenLive alone is incredible. It's available for macusers through macports, but it's hands down the best non-linear editor I've ever seen. This is the combintation I used for  my most recent screencasts; however, I do not think I will be able to continue the trend. I just switched to Mac because recent events with my linux system started to really hamper my development. I started to cry out for help and found a welcome tone with OS X. I don't want this to become a Linux v. OS X blog post, but I will say this: I finally got around some of the bugs I'd experienced in OS X that the team refuses to fix and millions continue to complain about. 2 things have always been my limiting factor for switching to OS X. No thanks to the team, I found my own solutions and am now comfortable with my decision. </p><br /><h2>What's next?</h2><p>What am I doing then? Well, I downloaded a new application that seems to give me what I've been looking for with both KdenLive and Gnome-Shell. That's Voila. Wish me luck and feel free to comment on any of my work to let me know how the switch is turning out.</p><div></div>
