<h2>Turning on Oracle Driver Tracing</h2>
You are probably asking right about now, "Why would I do this if I have p6spy?" Well, here
 are my reasons.<ul><li>P6Spy is a proxy on the driver. It watches SQL that goes in and 
prints it.</li><li>OJDBC in debug mode prints what goes in (not just SQL).</li><li>OJDBC
 in debug mode reports what comes out (including exceptions!)</li></ul>Basically, if there's
 an exception or any kind of warning handled by the driver, you would find out about it. 
This is useful for too many reasons to count. Further, it doesn't just spit out the SQL you
 send it. It spits out any requests to recover connections or API level communication
 happening in the backend. Really, anything over Net8 happens will get reported. That's 
huge if you're working with Oracle.<p>Without further ado, here it is. Pass the following
 in when starting your JVM.</p><p>
<pre>-Doracle.jdbc.Trace=true -Djava.util.logging.config.file=&lt;location of your java logging configuration file&gt;</pre>
<br /
>ojdbc debug mode uses java.util.logging framework to define its logging. You simply 
configure it. Here is what our config looks like:</p><p>
<pre>.level=SEVERE 
oracle.jdbc.level=WARNING
oracle.jdbc.handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level=WARNING
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=/usr/share/tomcat5/logs/jdbc.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count=3
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
</pre><br />We use a java.util.logging.FileHandler, but you can use the ConsoleHandler
 which is useful for development; however, this merges all your logs to file which may not 
always be ideal</p><p>That's it. If you're working with tomcat, just set this in your
 CATALINA_OPTS environment variable. You can also set this in your Eclipse JRE settings 
for your <a href="http://kuali.org">Kuali</a> project. If you're using eclipse, you may 
want to look at the <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-log-viewer">Eclipse Log Viewer</a>
plugin which will allow you to follow external logs from within eclipse.<div></div></p>
