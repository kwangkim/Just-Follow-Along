<h2>Please Leave Comments</h2>
<p>Again, more stuff related to the blog.</p><br /><h2>Why Should I?</h2><p>Well, I couldn't understand why I never get comments. I thought to myself, why would people not want to comment? I checked out my settings and found that you must be a registered user. I thought to myself, "Why would something like this stop someone from commenting?" Answer: "Maybe people want to remain anonymous on my blog." Solution: I've allowed anonymous users to post. Now please, let me know what you think of the screencasts. I've been experimenting with <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com">xtranormal</a>, so I want to know what people think of it and if it's worth continuing to pursue.</p><div></div>
