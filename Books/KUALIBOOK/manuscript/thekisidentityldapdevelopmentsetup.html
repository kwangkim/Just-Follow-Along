<h2>The KIS Identity - LDAP Development Setup</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>Before you can use the LDAP/Entity integration into your Kuali Rice-based application, you have to first build it into Kuali Rice. To do that, you first need to setup a development environment for building and packaging rice.<p><h3>Video Instructions</h3>I've put together a video for instruction how to not just setup your rice development environment, but also modularize the LDAP Integration source code distribution with Kuali Rice to be packaged and distributed together.</p><p>If you're an institution developing custom rice applications or just running rice-based kuali applications, you will most likely have your own rice release to add customizations too. LDAP integration in its current incarnation is pretty much that. It's like a third-party module/customization that is added to existing rice source.</p><p>This screencast is also using the Eclipse IDE. Again, if you have another IDE<br />or some other method. Please substitute whatever you would normally do.</p><p>Here it is. Enjoy:</p><p><br /><embed name="movie_player" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ILD2EHJvjPg?hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;et=OEgsToPDskJni4UfFH3f0WbK6L_15ohf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="false" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" allowscriptaccess="never" height="385" width="640"></embed></p>
