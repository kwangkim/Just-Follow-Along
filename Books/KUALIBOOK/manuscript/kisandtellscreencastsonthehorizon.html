<h2>KIS and Tell - Screencasts on the Horizon</h2>
I have started a screencast series on developing for Kuali.

Here are names of upcoming screencasts.<ul><li>KIS of the Dragon - Testing Liquibase Changelogs</li><li>KIS'ing Katie Holmes - Migrating an Oracle Database to Mysql with Liquibase and hsqldb</li><li>KIS KIS Bang Bang - Liquibase Automation</li><li>The Long KIS Goodnight - Automating Selenium Testing with Hudson CI and Amazon EC2</li><li>KIS Me Kate - RPM Packaging KFS</li><li>Pythagoras KIS - Exposing Quartz Scheduled Jobs via Web Service w/o KSB</li><li>The KIS Identity - University of Arizona LDAP Integration</li><li>The KIS Supremacy - Amazon EC2 and Launchpad for KFS</li><li>A KIS to Build a Dream On - Configuration Management of KFS at University of Arizona</li></ul><br />Stay tuned.
