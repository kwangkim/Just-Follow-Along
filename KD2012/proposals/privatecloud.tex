\maketitle
\abstract{Currently, the most popular solution for server
  virtualization at institutions is to use VMWare ESX Server. This
  allows institutions to quickly configure virtual servers for
  projects that need them. In the case of implementing Kuali
  applications, these include development, testing, configuration,
  staging, training and other environments. This comes at an overhead
  cost though. Institutions employ system administrators who's time is
  split across several projects to manage setup, maintenance, and security of these virtual
  machines.

  This session is to discuss virtual private cloud solutions like
  Eucalyptus and devops as a solution to this. First, imagine
  eliminating this overhead. Is it even possible? What kind of
  staffing, setup, process, and/or otherwise would be required to pull
  this off?
}
\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn about what kind of overhead exists in the traditional system
  administrator paradigm.
\item Discuss the effects on software project of that paradigm to
  determine if a change is important to institutions.
\item Discuss institution(s) stances on devops.
\item Pursue the possibility of virtual private cloud solutions. Can
  it help institutions? Can devops help process and efficiency of
  managing environments?
\item Discover necessary processes for institutions to handle their
  own private cloud solutions vs. hosted private cloud solutions.
