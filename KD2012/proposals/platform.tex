\abstract{See how to leverage Rice as a platform for your
  institution's future java applictions. Getting your institution to
  standardize on developing future applications with Rice as the
  platform has several advantages. With java clients as a use case,
  observe these advantages. For example, see examples of using a maven
  archetype to quickly create java clients aimed at the web services
  you plan to use. Observe best practices for a centralized
  infrastructure with Kuali Rice in the center.
  
  Rice as a platform also introduces some caveats to normal software
  development. Projects are no longer walled-gardens or developed in
  vacuums. One project can now be the dependency of another and
  provide services to other projects via the KSB. We need to change
  the way we view software development with Rice and develop
  acknowledging it as more than just middleware, but a plaform for
  centralized software development at our institutions.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developers will see examples and a proof-of-concept
  implementation of a java client project.
\item Developers will be shown patterns for event-driven SOA using
  Rice as a platform.
\item Devops will observe processes and patterns for managing projects
  that use Rice and how to deliver changes and change dependencies to
  other projects.
