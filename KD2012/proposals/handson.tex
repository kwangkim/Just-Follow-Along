\maketitle
\abstract{This full-day pre-conference workshop will provide an
  overview of KFS from a technical perspective. We will discuss the
  system requirements and architecture, critical concepts and
  services, and customization mechanisms. This will be a hands-on
  session. We will download and configure the financial system,
  bootstrap the database, and run OLTP and exercise the customization
  options together. Also, we will explore KFS development best
  practices, and customization based on authorization (KIM) and
  conditional routing (KEW).

Pre-requisites: The attendees should be Java developers with
experience with Ant, Spring, JQuery, and web applications in general. Own laptop configured and setup. Limited seats available. Registration for this session will close when the maximum number of attendees has been reached.

machine appliance software prior to arrival at Kuali Days. A link will
be provided.}
