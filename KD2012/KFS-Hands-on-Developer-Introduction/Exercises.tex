\begin{enumerate}
  \item Execute the VirtualBox installer to install the software.
  \item Copy the \textbf{KFSDev.box} from the distributed USB drive to
    your hard disk.
  \item Execute from a shell 
    \begin{minted}{sh}
      vagrant box add KFSDev KFSDev.box
    \end{minted}
  \item Import the Virtual Machine
    \begin{minted}{sh}
      vagrant up
    \end{minted}
  \item Stop the Virtual Machine
    \begin{minted}{sh}
      vagrant halt
    \end{minted}

\subsection*{Virtual Machine Manifest}
The VirtualBox appliance is an Ubuntu Linux distribution. Within it is
the software we will use for this class:
\begin{description}
  \item [Eclipse Indigo] the IDE used for class. Includes Subclipse,
    the m2eclipse plugin, and pre-installed projects with examples.
  \item [OpenJDK 1.7.0\_06 IcedTea] the JVM used for executing/testing
    examples.
  \item [Maven 3] used to build Rice applications, run tests, and
    start the Tomcat6 application
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Credentials}
\begin{description}
\item [User Account] is \textbf{kuali} with the password
  \textbf{kuali}. This is used to unlock the VM after it has suspended,
  gone to sleep, or locked. The password is also required for
  executing commands as \textbf{root} which may on occassion be
  required. The user account home directory is located at
  \textbf{/home/kuali} and will frequently be referred to during the training.
\item [Database Account] uses the jdbc connection string
  \textbf{jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kuldemo} and the
  username/password \textbf{kuldemo}/\textbf{kuldemo}. These are the
  default credentials and database connection information as defined
  in kul-cfg-dbs.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Structure}
The Eclipse workspace is located at \textbf{/home/kuali/workspace}.
